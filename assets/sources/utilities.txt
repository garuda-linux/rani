== Terminal ==

=== Command shells ===

See the main article: [[Command-line shell]].

See also [[Wikipedia:Comparison of command shells]].

=== Terminal emulators ===

Terminal emulators show a GUI Window that contains a terminal. Most emulate Xterm, which in turn emulates VT102, which emulates typewriter. For further background information, see [[Wikipedia:Terminal emulator]].

For a comprehensive list, see [[Wikipedia:List of terminal emulators]].
